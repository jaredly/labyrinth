# For Condos

Make it so you can calculate the length of walls.
like, how to cut up some rope to make the walls
of this labyrinth


- [x] ooh for downloading, I could uniquely identify by hash. that would be cool.

# V4???

- [x] make it so that it still shows rainbows even if there are breaks
  - just have multiple lines, its fine
- [ ] hovering a section number should highlight the section?
- [ ] removing a layer should remove the things on it as well.
- [ ] adding a column should bridge automatically

- [x] basic separators
- [x] maybe I can haz a curve?

So, I want to change the orientation.
And change the way I calculate where I think you're going.
and do a more convincing loop-around.

- [x] click + drag to make it all up
- [x] add "rows" to sections
- [x] add/remove "sections"
- [x] export pls
- [x] rainbowwwwwww
- [ ] when removing a section, bring things together
- [ ] show N & S
- [x] round round round round round
  - [x] round round round


# V3

- [x] basic cart
- [x] basic circlular
- [x] nicer rendering
- [ ] add rows to section

# V2

- [x] basic toggle of pairs
- [x] adaptive width
- [ ] move sections locations
- [ ] add/remove sections
- [ ] add/remove lines
- [ ] auto-add things to the right, prolly, right?


So, I think a better model would actually be to
have the "sections" be first-class.





Left side:
- be able to "add in" lines between things
- section centers can be a full row, not just in between

- Different visualizations:
  - [x] Cartesian
  - [x] Circle
  - [ ] Polygon
  - [ ] offset polygon
  - [ ] ?? offset circle ??


#

- [ ] click a line to toggle it?



- [x] circles in the middle
- [x] move a bunches
- [ ] select a rect pls
- [x] export : show the cartesian dealiwaps
- [x] rainbow color the labyrinth for distance
  - betterrr rainbow?
