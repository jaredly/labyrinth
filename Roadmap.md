# Ok friends, now that ... I can generate things to cnc route
how about some good old
animations
and games
perhaps

- [x] basic animate!
- [ ] in & out please
- [ ] better "stop" mechanism
- [x] have it be a separate mode probably?
- [ ] umm mobile friendly?
- [x] have a "dot" mode, where you just follow the dot

- [ ] speed up along straightaways.
  can I just have it be based on current curvature? could be fun



- [x] make a version where you zoom in and follow the leading point!

## Simplest Idea

Meditation timer
- show a labyrinth, it slowly fills up, then retreats

- Need to do a "path fill" thing, right?

## More complex idea

You're ~navigating the labyrinth, turning your phone around (detected using deviceorientationchange w/ magnetometer)
to turn, press & hold to "move forward". idk.


# For Condos

Make it so you can calculate the length of walls.
like, how to cut up some rope to make the walls
of this labyrinth


- [x] ooh for downloading, I could uniquely identify by hash. that would be cool.

# V4???

- [x] make it so that it still shows rainbows even if there are breaks
  - just have multiple lines, its fine
- [ ] hovering a section number should highlight the section?
- [ ] removing a layer should remove the things on it as well.
- [ ] adding a column should bridge automatically

- [x] basic separators
- [x] maybe I can haz a curve?

So, I want to change the orientation.
And change the way I calculate where I think you're going.
and do a more convincing loop-around.

- [x] click + drag to make it all up
- [x] add "rows" to sections
- [x] add/remove "sections"
- [x] export pls
- [x] rainbowwwwwww
- [ ] when removing a section, bring things together
- [ ] show N & S
- [x] round round round round round
  - [x] round round round


# V3

- [x] basic cart
- [x] basic circlular
- [x] nicer rendering
- [ ] add rows to section

# V2

- [x] basic toggle of pairs
- [x] adaptive width
- [ ] move sections locations
- [ ] add/remove sections
- [ ] add/remove lines
- [ ] auto-add things to the right, prolly, right?


So, I think a better model would actually be to
have the "sections" be first-class.





Left side:
- be able to "add in" lines between things
- section centers can be a full row, not just in between

- Different visualizations:
  - [x] Cartesian
  - [x] Circle
  - [ ] Polygon
  - [ ] offset polygon
  - [ ] ?? offset circle ??


#

- [ ] click a line to toggle it?



- [x] circles in the middle
- [x] move a bunches
- [ ] select a rect pls
- [x] export : show the cartesian dealiwaps
- [x] rainbow color the labyrinth for distance
  - betterrr rainbow?
